After you install this software you will may think that design is somehow familiar, yes if you opened the Unreal Engine atleast once you will notice the similarity...

## First step:
You may want to choose your Project location (you do that with that you browse your project's .uproject file) that will be backupped at your choosen Backup location.

## Features:

### Save:
What i said before you can able to save projects in two way either manually or automatically with an interval, you can also set the interval that will affect the how frequntly your project will be backupped.
You can set the Automatic save interval to: 2hr, 4hr, 6hr, 8hr, 12hr, and 24hr also, so you can will be flexible with your work flow with those options.

The blue circle indicates the unzip/zipping process, than if it's successfully finished you'll see a green circle, if something is failing you'll see a yellow cicrle.

### Listing projects:
The program will dynamically list out all the backup projects from your choosen Backup location, you'll see some dates that's basically represents the save time of that version of the project so you can easily pick from those version, if somehow your current project is broken down, you have two option with a backupped version of your project you can open the backup location, and also you can unzip it and than after that the program will launch the project automatically as well.

I may suggest atleast to backup your unreal projects, once in a day (and it's also depends on the project, work flow .etc). It's important especially when you work on your videogame project, you may will encounter some bugs, data-loss as well (my own experience), and 
yeah it's don't really feels good when you work on something for about a year and than suddenly lost everything because of a bug, and also you'll have a better understanding and a comprehensive view of your work and version history as well.
